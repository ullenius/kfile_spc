kfile_spc

This is a KFileMetaInfo plugin to display information on the SPC format used
by the Super Nintendo.

To build and install:
$ make
$ make install

It requires GNU make (and the KDE development packages) at this time.  No
external SPC libraries are needed, however. If you have problems, please e-mail
me and I'll get around to porting it to the bksys solution I'm currently using.
