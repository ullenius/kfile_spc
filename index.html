<p>This is a KFileMetaInfo plugin for reading metadata on SNES SPC files.</p>

<p>SPC files are a sort of music dump from Super NES games.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220131330/http://www.zophar.net/zsnes/spc/">http://www.zophar.net/zsnes/spc/</a>
has a good archive, and you can also try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220131330/http://www.snesmusic.org/spcsets/">http://www.snesmusic.org/spcsets/</a>.</p>

<p>As far as SPC <em>players</em> go, the choices on Linux are rather limited.
There is an XMMS plugin to play SPCs, and Neil Stevens has ported a program
called OpenSPC to play through aRts.  Notice that it isn't an aRts plugin, it
merely uses aRts to play the file.  You can find the program, called OpenSPC
Lite, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220131330/http://www.hakubi.us/ospc/">Neil's website</a>.</p>

<p>Lately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220131330/http://www.c133.org/blog/">clee</a>'s SPC plugin for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060220131330/http://www.gstreamer.org/">gstreamer</a> has been integrated into their
development version, so hopefully we will have SPC support in a major sound
system in time for KDE 4. :-)</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

Current version: <a href="kfile_spc-0.5.1.tar.bz2">kfile_spc 0.5.1</a>
 <i>(10.7 K)</i><br>

<br>

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
<li>Supports reading and writing the different types of tags supported by the
ID666 tag format for SNES SPC files.  The format is rather limited, and has two
slightly different incarnations which I've tried to detect.  The tags are
always written out in ID666 binary mode.</li>
</ul>

<b>Limitations:</b>
<ul>
<li>The date seems to be inaccurate, which I think is due to a bug in
KFileMetaInfoWidget, which I have patched for KDE CVS HEAD (and might be
backported to KDE 3.3.3</li>
<li>To save space (the archive is smaller than the screenshot!), I've packaged
the program using the Makefile template that I used to use for <a href="/web/20060220131330/https://grammarian.homelinux.net/abakus/">abakus</a> and <a href="/web/20060220131330/https://grammarian.homelinux.net/~kde-cvs/tacky/">tacky</a>.  It should
be able to build and install for you if you have GNU make, but don't be
surprised if something or the other goes wrong.</li>
<li>For those who can't build the plain Makefile version, I've also packaged
a version that uses the autotools, which should work everywhere you can build
KDE.  Please don't download if the Makefile version does work for you, as it
is much larger, and I'm hosting it off of my computer. ;)</li>
<li>Doesn't support the extended ID666 tag format.</li>
</ul>
